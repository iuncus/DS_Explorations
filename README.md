# Data Science Explorations

## Overview
This repository contains various Jupyter notebooks exploring different aspects of data science, including API interactions, summary statistics, regression analysis, and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Notebooks

### API Exploration
- **API-test.ipynb**: Tests the Met API, though the API itself appears to be bugged.
- **ChicagoAPI.ipynb**: Interacts with the Art Institute of Chicago API.
- **NASAapi.ipynb**: Demonstrates a functional use of the NASA APoD API to display images.

### Statistical Analysis
- **StatsandPlots.ipynb**: Computes summary statistics and generates plots for data visualization.

### Regression Analysis
- **RegressionandPrediction.ipynb**: Implements regression techniques for predictive modeling.

### Unsupervised Learning
- **UnsupervisedLearning.ipynb**: Explores clustering techniques, including UMAP and other unsupervised learning methods.

## Usage
Ensure all dependencies are installed, run cells in notebooks.
